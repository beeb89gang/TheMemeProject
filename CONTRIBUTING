This project is for memes. If you want to contribute in the discussions or in the code, you can freely, but you must be respectful. 
Besides possible jokes and funny discussions, you have to follow two simple principles:

- Everything you share in terms of code, even if it's an antipattern or spaghetti code, it must work somehow and must NOT be malicious. 
- Everything you propose as code or PR must be feasible. 

Other than that, please help us in this project, we really appreciate the (free) work of others here :)
