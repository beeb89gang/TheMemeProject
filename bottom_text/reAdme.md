> WE ARE GOING FLASK PYTHON BOYS


~~# what ~~

~~so basically we googled in google and found this guide (https://geekflare.com/javascript-frameworks-for-api/).~~
~~they say hapi is the best, but to be sure we checked out also restify (used by netflics!!!1!).~~

### reasons to chose hapi over restify

~~- hapi documentations are in dark mode by default~~
~~- hapi rhymes with papi~~


~~### reasons not to chose hapi~~

~~- is using node.js, but actually node is good for this kinda of things~~
