## What's this project about

![](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/033/152/cover4.jpg)


\>so basically we want to view memes using our tv. but these memes must be sent from us using a telegram bot... or maybe not. i mean, even automatically from reddit or any other sources should be ok.

\>how many memes? many

\>we should use an old 160 gb ata drive for everything, but in the mean time we should look for an upgrade with an nvme drive to reduce iops, cauz the lesser iops, the more bups
