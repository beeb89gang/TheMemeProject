# what

so basically, a proper way to create a stupid telegram bot would be to use node.js, for example, or the simplest technology we can find.
python.

im not into snakes or lizards, but python should be ok i think. we dont want to deep dive for this thing, its just a bleedy bloody images and video collector u send. obviously u must authorize people with a certain USER ID so that they can use the bot. 

## pro tip

remember not to push the .env with the bot token id. or if you do it then recreate it. and dont push it again in the repo for the love of god.
